# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
This Prework Study Guide is the by-product of a lot of trial and error while completing the Boot Camp Prework. The notes are an accumulation of knowledge gained while undertaking Prework and information that I have gained while studying and waiting for class to begin. It contains notes and references pertaining to: Computational Thinking, Agile Software Environment, The Web, Git, GitHub, Terminal, README, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

From beginning to end, this project has served its purpose ten fold with knowledge gained, techniques understood, and shorthand commands compiled into a succint package. It gave me no other option than to believe in myself.

I spent many years operating different industrial machines; the machine changed with every job that came and went, but it either worked or it didn't. 
"Remove the obstacle to function." 
Turns out my self-doubt was the obstacle. 

I am so proud of myself right now; I cannot begin to imagine what emotions will bubble to the surface as I look back towards the end of Boot Camp.
